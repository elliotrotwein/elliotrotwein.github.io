Hi and welcome to my software engineering blog. This site will primarily serve as a way for me to share what I'm learning as a software engineer in my day job and free time. Also I'll be sharing about some side projects that I'm working on. I hope you find the content useful and interesting. If you have any questions or comments please reach out!
